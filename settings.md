## settings of the parameters

There are two pendulums, with two degrees of freedom each: in the X and in the Y direction. 
Each of these degrees of freedom has three parameters: a frequency, a damping parameter
and a phase (chosen in units of pi/16 with the sliders to the left; so choosing a value of 32
corresponds with a value of 2*pi). Parameters 1 and 2 are for the X directions, 3 and 4
for the Y directions of the first and the second pendulum.

The nicest results are obtained when values for the frequency are integers, or very close to an integer 
(though values ending on .5, or very close to that, can also give good results).

Approximate values for the frequency can be set using the sliders; for fine-tuning, you can use the 
left and right arrow keys (only tested on Ubuntu with Firefox).
