## The harmonograph

### Background

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph "Wikipedia entry on 'Harmonograph'"): 

> A harmonograph is a mechanical apparatus that employs pendulums to create a geometric image. The drawings created typically are Lissajous curves, or related drawings of greater complexity. The devices, which began to appear in the mid-19th century and peaked in popularity in the 1890s, cannot be conclusively attributed to a single person, although Hugh Blackburn, a professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow, is commonly believed to be the official inventor.[1]

### This shiny application

The application you're looking at now simulated a two-pendulum harmonograph, where each pendulum has two degrees of freedom. 
That means that we'll have to choose four sets of parameters. For each virtual pendulum, and for each degree of freedom we'll have to set values for
<ul>
<li>frequency
<li>damping
<li>phase
</ul>
More information on these, and some guidance for settings leading to nice 'harmonograms' are given on the tab 'Settings'.

This application was inspired by a blog post ['Beautiful curves'](http://aschinchon.wordpress.com/2014/10/13/beautiful-curves-the-harmonograph/) by 'Ripples', and uses some extra information from [Walking Randomly](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=151)
